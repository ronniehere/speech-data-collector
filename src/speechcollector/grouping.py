"""Group transcript segments into readable paragraphs — the core of speechcollector.

Pause-primary strategy: the silences between segments are the strongest
signal of where one thought ends and the next begins.

1.  Inter-segment gaps are measured, then normalized against the *typical*
    gap of the transcript. YouTube auto-captions are rolling windows that
    systematically overlap (every raw gap is negative); subtracting the
    median gap recovers the real pauses hiding inside that overlap, while
    leaving well-behaved manual captions untouched.
2.  Pauses longer than ``pause_threshold_s`` (after normalization) are hard
    paragraph breaks — a speaker who stops that long has changed topic.
    A deliberate consequence of pause-primacy: a long mid-sentence emphasis
    pause can end a paragraph on a comma. That is intended, not a bug.
3.  Inside each pause-delimited run, paragraphs grow toward a word budget.
    When the budget window (``min_words``..``max_words``) is reached, the
    break lands on the best-scoring candidate. The score weighs pause length
    (dominant) and refines with both sides of the boundary: sentence/clause/
    ellipsis punctuation and a dangling-word penalty on the segment that ends
    the paragraph, plus a discourse-marker bonus / continuation penalty on the
    segment that would start the next one. So punctuated transcripts break at
    sentence ends and unpunctuated auto-captions still break at the most
    natural breath in the window.

The module is pure and deterministic: no I/O, no randomness, stdlib only.
