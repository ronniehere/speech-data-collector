"""Optional speaker diarization for single-voice TTS datasets (the ``[diarize]`` extra).

Whisper/Parakeet produce one unlabeled transcript, so concatenating multi-speaker
audio splices every voice into one "speaker" — fatal for single-voice TTS. This
module adds an *optional* speaker timeline and assigns each clip a speaker.

The design is pluggable and offline-testable: the pure ``assign_speaker`` takes a
normalized list of :class:`SpeakerTurn` (speaker, start, end) — from *any* diarizer
— and assigns a clip its **maximum-total-overlap** speaker plus a purity score
(dominant overlap / total overlapped speech), so cross-speaker clips can be dropped.

The real backend is :class:`PyannoteDiarizer` (lazy-imported, so a plain install
never pays the torch import cost). It is gated: the user must accept the model's
conditions on Hugging Face and provide a read token (``HF_TOKEN``). When the extra
is not installed the build degrades cleanly to a mixed-speaker dataset with a warning.
