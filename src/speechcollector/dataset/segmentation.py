"""Segment word-level transcript timings into TTS/STT training clips — the D1 core.

Pure and deterministic (no I/O, no randomness, stdlib + pydantic only): a list of
time-aligned ``Word`` objects in, a list of ``DatasetSegment`` clips out. The clip
is sized by *duration in seconds* (not word count — that is the one structural
departure from the markdown grouper in ``grouping.py``, whose three-phase shape and
scoring vocabulary this mirrors), cut on sentence/pause boundaries, clamped to
``[min_s, max_s]``, and — crucially — **never split mid-word**.

Three phases:

1. **Repair + hard-break.** Each word's span is repaired *per word* (finite,
   non-negative, ``end >= start``) without mutating the originals; the original
   ``Word`` objects are what we emit, so the lossless partition is exact. Long
   inter-word silences become hard paragraph breaks ("runs").
2. **Grow-then-cut.** Inside each run a clip grows until its duration enters the
   ``[min_s, max_s]`` window, then breaks at the best-scoring boundary: pause is
   the dominant currency, refined by sentence/clause punctuation and the same
   dangling-word / discourse-marker cues as ``grouping.py`` (the input is now
   words — the granularity those cues were designed for).
3. **Tiny-tail fix.** A trailing clip shorter than ``min_s`` merges back into its
   predecessor unless a very long pause genuinely isolates it (an outro).

**Duration is computed from the segment's *extent*** — the minimum word start and
maximum word end over the range — not just its endpoint words. ASR timings are
noisy (faster-whisper can emit a glitched far-future end on an interior word); an
endpoint-only duration would let such a word hide inside an in-bounds-looking clip
and silently violate the duration bound. The extent both keeps every clip's span
honest (it always contains its words) and is monotone as a range grows (so the
grow loop's overshoot logic is valid). Correctness invariant: requirement
"never split a word" strictly dominates "respect ``max_s``" — an unbreakable run
is emitted whole and flagged ``oversized``.

        max_s: Maximum clip duration (seconds). Only exceeded by an unbreakable run

        pause_break_s: Inter-word silence (seconds) that forces a hard clip break.
